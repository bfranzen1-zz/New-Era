New era is a fault-tolerant Earthquake Emergency Alert System that can be deployed with a device to alert users before certain events occur.
In the event that there are major infrastructure failures the system should be able to overcome relevant issues to still provide alerting to users.
This project is part of Phase 1 for the West Coast ShakeAlert System hosted by the United States Geological Service (USGS) for California, Oregon, and Washington.
